# AI-Powered ElasticSearch Query Generator

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the search functionality of an e-commerce platform by allowing users to input their queries in natural language. The system uses AI to convert these queries into structured ElasticSearch queries, which are then used to fetch products from an ElasticSearch database.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly search experience where users can enter search queries in natural language. The system translates these queries into ElasticSearch queries to retrieve relevant products from the database efficiently.

## Approach

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The core of this project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and interpret user queries. The system uses a pre-trained language model to parse and extract relevant information from the user's input. This involves:
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifying key entities such as product names, categories, price ranges, and other attributes.
- **Context Understanding**: Grasping the context and intent behind the query to ensure accurate information extraction.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Analyzing the structure of the query to parse meaningful components.

### Query Generation
Once the user's query is understood, the system generates a structured ElasticSearch query. This involves:
- **Mapping Extracted Data**: Associating the parsed entities with the corresponding fields in the ElasticSearch index.
- **Constructing Query DSL**: Formulating the query in ElasticSearch's Domain Specific Language (DSL) to include filters, ranges, and sorting based on the extracted information.
- **Validation**: Ensuring the generated query adheres to the schema and constraints of the ElasticSearch index.

### ElasticSearch Integration
The generated query is then executed against an ElasticSearch database. ElasticSearch is chosen for its powerful full-text search capabilities and scalability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of product data. This integration involves:
- **Connection Management**: Establishing and maintaining a connection to the ElasticSearch cluster.
- **Query Execution**: Running the generated query against the database.
- **Result Handling**: Fetching and formatting the results for display.

## Components

### AI Model
An AI language model is used to interpret the user's natural language query. This model is capable of:
- **Understanding Complex Queries**: Comprehending multi-faceted queries with various constraints and conditions.
- **Extracting Relevant Information**: Identifying product names, categories, price ranges, ratings, and other relevant details from the query.
- **Generating Structured Outputs**: Producing outputs that can be directly used to form ElasticSearch queries.

### Query Parser
A query parser is responsible for converting the extracted information into a valid ElasticSearch query. It ensures that:
- **Field Mapping**: The extracted data is correctly mapped to the corresponding fields in the ElasticSearch index.
- **Query Structuring**: The query is structured to include necessary filters, ranges, and sorting options.
- **Compliance**: The query adheres to the schema and structure expected by the ElasticSearch index.

### ElasticSearch Database
ElasticSearch is used to store and manage the product data. It provides:
- **Full-Text Search**: Advanced text search capabilities to match user queries against product descriptions.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle large datasets and high query volumes.
- **Faceted Search**: Support for faceted search to allow filtering by categories, price ranges, ratings, and other attributes.

## Process Flow

### Step 1: User Input
The user enters a search query in natural language through the search interface.

### Step 2: Query Interpretation
The AI model processes the query to:
- Understand the user's intent.
- Extract key information such as product names, categories, price ranges, and ratings.

### Step 3: Query Generation
Using the extracted information:
- The query parser maps the data to the appropriate fields in the ElasticSearch index.
- Constructs a valid ElasticSearch query DSL.
- Ensures the query adheres to the schema and constraints.

### Step 4: Query Execution
The generated query is executed against the ElasticSearch database:
- The connection to the ElasticSearch cluster is established.
- The query is run to fetch matching products.

### Step 5: Result Retrieval
The search results are fetched and formatted for display:
- Results are displayed to the user in a user-friendly format.
- Pagination is handled to allow users to navigate through multiple pages of results.

## Dependencies

### NLP and AI
- **OpenAI's language model**: For natural language processing and query interpretation.
- **LangChain**: For managing language model chains and prompts.

### Search Engine
- **ElasticSearch**: For storing and querying the product data.
- **OpenSearch**: For connecting to and interacting with the ElasticSearch database.
